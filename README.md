# coditation_assignmen


The goal of this project was to make a computer game using MATLAB, and Connect Four seemed like the most fun. We wanted our MATLAB version of Connect Four to be as realistic to the actual board game as possible. We wanted all the same rules to apply. The motivation for this project came from the desire to give Professor Cheever a fun game to play over winter break, and from the aspiration to make a game people can really play on the computer. This project is interesting because the code involves some complicated nested for loops and if then statements. This project took a lot of problem solving, but with lots of trial and error we were successful with creating Connect Four on MATLAB.
